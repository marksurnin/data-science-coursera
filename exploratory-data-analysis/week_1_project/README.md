## Week 1 Project

My overall goal here is simply to examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007. My task is to reconstruct four plots, all of which were constructed using the base plotting system.

This assignment uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, a popular repository for machine learning datasets. The dataset contains measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.
